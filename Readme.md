# General Info

This is my fork from the program "Visual Novel Reader", a tool for getting text from visual novels and automatically translating them. (Very useful when playing games that do not have many language options).

As we know, games are getting all the more complex these days, which means that programs like this (and also tools for making translation patches) could really use help from the community.

Looking forward to getting this project more contributers by forking it here... (Although I'm really more of a learner here...)

PS. It seems that most of the source files are in the Framework directory, and seems like a mix of many different projects, it may be that the program is not completely open source after all (just released part of the code, and then got onto github with various means)


# 概览

这是我从 VNR 程序(一个用于提取视觉小说游戏（大部分galgame）的文字并进行自动翻译的程序)分支出来的仓库。（对于语言选项很少的游戏（经常是只有日语，gg）h大有用处）

我们都知道，游戏都越来越复杂了，这样的程序（和用于制作翻译补丁的程序）很需要社区的共同协作（不然程序没有维护，很快就可能gg的）。

希望在这里进行分支能够让更多人参与到这里面来（尽管我很怀疑我本人能不能真的有所贡献。。。）

（求扩散）

PS. 似乎大部分代码都在 “Framework” 目录下，而看起来似乎是很多项目的集合，很可能VNR本身并没有开源，只是公布了一部分代码，然后不知道怎样就上了github。。。
